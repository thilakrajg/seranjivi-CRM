<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested to build a full-stack Sales CRM, Sightspectrum, with a specific tech stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) and a comprehensive set of features including authentication, various modules (Clients, Leads, etc.), and workflow automation.

Throughout the session, the user added several major feature requests:
1.  **Complete UI Redesign:** Overhaul the entire application for a cozy, neat, clean, minimal look with a collapsible sidebar and compact UI elements.
2.  **Employee Performance Page:** Transform the static Employees table into a modern, two-column dynamic performance dashboard.
3.  **File Attachments:** Implement multi-file upload functionality for Leads, Opportunities, and SOWs, including a new Attachment column in tables.
4.  **Created Date Feature:** Add a read-only Date (Created Date) field to all forms and a corresponding Date column to all list pages for major modules.
5.  **Major CRM Transformation (Latest Request):** A global update including:
    *   A new sidebar menu order.
    *   Renaming Vendors to Partners.
    *   Implementing a global, sequential  (e.g., SAL0001) shared across Leads, Opportunities, and new modules.
    *   Adding three new modules: , , and .
    *   Updating existing modules (, ) with new fields.
    *   A new  design incorporating data from all modules.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a functional full-stack Sales CRM. It has undergone a significant UI overhaul, resulting in a compact, modern design with a collapsible sidebar. Several key features have been implemented: a dynamic two-column Employee Performance page, a multi-file attachment system for core modules, and a Created Date field across the application.

Most recently, the agent implemented the foundational backend and frontend for a major CRM transformation, including:
*   A new global Task ID system.
*   Renaming the Vendors module to Partners across the stack.
*   Creating the backend and frontend for three new modules: Action Items, Sales Activity Tracker, and Forecast Tracker.
*   Updating the sidebar navigation to the new user-specified order.

The new modules are created but currently contain no data.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user pointed out that the newly created pages (Action Items, Sales Activity, Forecast) were empty. The agent created a new seed script  to populate these modules with sample data. The script has been created but not yet executed.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** main agent to test via  followed by the screenshot tool to verify data appears on the frontend pages.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: (P0) New modules are empty.
-   Issue 2: (P1) The Import functionality is not implemented.

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: New modules are empty.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent created  to generate sample data for , , and .
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Execute the script: 🌱 Seeding new modules with sample data...
📦 Clearing existing sample data...
✨ Inserting Action Items...
   ✓ Created 5 action items
✨ Inserting Sales Activities...
   ✓ Created 5 sales activities
✨ Inserting Forecasts...
   ✓ Created 5 forecasts

🎉 Sample data seeding completed successfully!
   Total Action Items: 5
   Total Sales Activities: 5
   Total Forecasts: 5
   Total Forecast Amount: $1,327,500.
        2.  Restart the backend server if necessary to ensure data is loaded.
        3.  Use the screenshot tool to navigate to the Action Items, Sales Activity Tracker, and Forecast Tracker pages to confirm that sample data is now displayed.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To fulfill the user's direct request for sample data and make the new modules functional for demonstration and testing.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

-   **Issue 2: The Import functionality is not implemented.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. An Import button exists on list pages, but it's a UI placeholder with no backend logic.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **Backend:** Create a generic API endpoint (e.g., ) that accepts a file upload.
        2.  Use a library like  to parse CSV/XLSX files.
        3.  Implement logic to validate data and perform bulk inserts into the correct MongoDB collection.
        4.  **Frontend:** Update the  function in  or page components to open a file dialog and POST the selected file to the new endpoint.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will complete a core feature requested early in the project, enabling users to perform bulk data entry.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: Complete the major CRM Transformation.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Immediate Action:** The user is waiting for sample data. Your first step must be to execute the  script and verify that the new module pages (Action Items, Sales Activity, Forecasts) are populated.
2.  **Project Context:** The project is in the middle of a large, phased CRM transformation. Phases 1-3 are complete. You are expected to start Phase 4 (Dashboard Redesign) after seeding the data.
3.  **Unfinished Feature:** The Import functionality has been requested since the beginning but remains unimplemented. It is a lower priority than the current CRM transformation but should be addressed soon.
4.  **Global Task ID:** Remember that the  is a crucial, shared identifier. When creating new records in related modules (e.g., an Action Item from an Opportunity), this ID must be passed along.
